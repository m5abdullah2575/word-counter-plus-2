## Understanding Plagiarism in Academic Writing

Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own without proper attribution. In academic and professional settings, plagiarism is a serious offense that can result in failing grades, expulsion, or damaged professional reputation.

## Types of Plagiarism

### Direct Plagiarism
- **Definition**: Copying text word-for-word without quotation marks or citation
- **Examples**: Copy-pasting from websites, books, or other sources
- **Severity**: Most serious form, often intentional
- **Consequences**: Immediate academic penalties

### Self-Plagiarism
- **Definition**: Reusing your own previously submitted work
- **Examples**: Submitting same paper to multiple classes
- **Common misconception**: "It's my work, so it's okay"
- **Reality**: Still academic dishonesty

### Mosaic Plagiarism (Patchwriting)
- **Definition**: Mixing copied phrases with your own words
- **Examples**: Changing few words while keeping sentence structure
- **Detection**: Often caught by plagiarism checkers
- **Problem**: Shows lack of understanding

### Paraphrasing Plagiarism
- **Definition**: Rewording someone's ideas without citation
- **Examples**: Expressing someone's argument in different words without credit
- **Misconception**: Changing words makes it original
- **Truth**: Ideas still need attribution

### Accidental Plagiarism
- **Definition**: Unintentional failure to cite sources properly
- **Causes**: Poor note-taking, forgetting sources, not understanding citation rules
- **Impact**: Still carries consequences
- **Prevention**: Careful documentation from start

5. Maintain original meaning
6. Always cite the source

**Example:**
- **Original**: "Climate change poses significant risks to global food security through altered precipitation patterns and increased temperature extremes."
- **Good Paraphrase**: Changes in global climate threaten worldwide food production by modifying rainfall distribution and creating more severe temperature variations (Author, Year).
- **Bad Paraphrase**: Climate change presents major risks to worldwide food security via changed rainfall patterns and temperature extremes. (Too similar!)

## Understanding Paraphrase Detection Technology
