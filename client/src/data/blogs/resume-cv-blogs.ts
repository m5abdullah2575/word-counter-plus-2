## Understanding Applicant Tracking Systems

Over 75% of resumes never reach human eyes because they fail to pass Applicant Tracking System (ATS) screening. Understanding how ATS works and optimizing your resume accordingly is essential for job search success in today's digital hiring landscape.

## How ATS Systems Work

### Resume Parsing Process

- Converts various formats to readable text
- Some systems struggle with complex formatting

**Step 2: Data Extraction**
- Identifies contact information
- Parses work experience
- Extracts education details
- Recognizes skills and keywords

**Step 3: Scoring and Ranking**
- Matches keywords from job description
- Calculates relevance score
- Ranks against other applicants
- Flags for human review if score sufficient

### What ATS Scans For
**Essential Elements:**
- Keywords from job posting
- Relevant job titles
- Required skills and qualifications
- Education and certifications
- Years of experience
- Employment dates and companies

**Ranking Factors:**
- Keyword frequency and placement
- Contextual keyword usage
- Skills match percentage
- Experience relevance
- Education requirements met

## ATS-Friendly Formatting

### File Format Requirements
**Best Formats:**
- .docx (Microsoft Word) - Most compatible

- Images or graphics
- Password-protected files

### Layout and Structure
